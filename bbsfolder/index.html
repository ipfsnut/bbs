The making of Bring Back Satire started in January, 2020. I was newly engaged with the Cent platform, and made the executive decision to allow it to impact the book. I published essays, poems, and short stories together in one volume. Viva Variety!<br><br>

Here we are, 15 months later. Instead of a simple book, Bring Back Satire is now the vehicle I've used to figure out how to mint books to the blockchain. <br><br>

I've even founded the Libernet DAO to ensure that blockchain protocols can be cost-effectively used to allow authors everywhere to earn a much higher portion of the proceeds generated by their work.<br><br>

We'll just mint our books to the blockchain, then they'll be available everywhere.<br><br>

<br><br>
Cheers,<br><br>

    Why (And How) I’m Giving Away <br> My Philosophy Book About Happiness
    <br> Via WAX & IPFS </h2>

            Publishing is a tough industry to break into. Even if people really dig your work, it can be tough to convince a publishing house to go along with it. When you do, you’ll find that legal matters are seldom simple and that no real support network exists to get the word out. So you’ll stump, and most of who do so fail. I’ve decided to make a statement by giving the world my happiness book, Bring Back Satire, for free. All anyone needs to do is figure out how to view an IPFS node in their web browser <br>

            (hint: use ipfs.io/ipfs/ and add the hash Qmc38BKePNVudiHuJ9zMLa4B9EQzUy5YyUPtZ9ScaQYHHg ) to read the book and learn a few things about the philosophy of happiness that has come out of Aristotle’s ancient texts.<br><br>

            I minted a single Bring Back Satire to Ethereum on January 14, 2021, and it started a revolution in my life that has resulted in me getting very deep into the NFT universe. How deep? Keep reading and you’ll find out. <br><br>



            That first print was a misprint, and the gas cost of a full run of the books is prohibitive. I was shocked to be able to navigate the process via WAX this evening without having to make a single deposit of any kind into my wallet. There was a bit of a puzzle involved with the minting process just in terms of getting wax.atomichub.io figured out, but the first six copies of the book have been minted. <br><br>

            I selected 15% in the royalty box and my strategy is to help my friends out financially by sending them these books to sell whenever and however they like; the royalty will enable me to earn income despite giving the book away due to the longevity of the collectors’ market for scarce literature. My reasoning in this mad distribution scheme is simple enough: a philosophy book about happiness is a good thing for people to be able to get at during a pandemic that is resulting in all sorts of misery. <br><br>

            The NFT assets themselves are simply the equivalent of signed memorabilia that the market can set its own price for. I’ve placed one copy for sale at around $50 and opened a no-reserve auction for another starting at around $5, then based on the way these endeavors go I will incorporate feedback moving forward. I’m not all that concerned about the price of each object, either, as I receive a 15% royalty each time one of them is traded.<br><br>

            I’m quite fascinated by this new market and I can’t wait to see how things continue to play out! It was a bit difficult to get set up on WAX, but the savings you’ll experience with respect to the costs of operation are more than worth the hassle involved with figuring out how this new ecosystem works. <br><br>

  Cheers,<br><br>

            Thomas Dylan Daniel, M.A. is a philosopher, writer, scientist, and entrepreneur from San Angelo, Texas. His best-known work, Formal Dialectics, is a peer-reviewed philosophical treatise about the ramifications of postmodern thinking on the classical Enlightenment values that colored his own education. In it, Daniel extrapolates from the Gödel Incompleteness Theorem’s classical use-case in mathematics to a far more generalized case: all of language.<br><br>

            Daniel’s interests are wide-ranging: his predominant philosophical preoccupation is the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy of mind, necessitating studies ranging from physiology to neurophysiology to cognitive neuroscience to psycholinguistics to cognitive anthropology to linguistic anthropology, computer science, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, quantum mechanics, biophysics, and medicine.<br><br>

            The author has done an absurd amount of reading. Generally, he’s made his way by having ideas, which then prove to be wrong. In understanding, so to speak, why a given spitball didn’t stick to a particular wall, the author seems to be able to infer principles that relate to the world. The author is simultaneously convinced that it must be about like this for everyone and mystified that other people don’t follow certain ideas as readily as it seems they should, sometimes.<br><br>

            In lieu of a perfect avenue of communication, and in light of the limitations of the present means expressed above, the author would like to reserve the right to send additional NFTs to the holder of this, the very first NFiT. Hopefully, as an example of what is possible, this artifact will turn out to be rather significant despite its minimalism.<br><br>
